Broader crypto market sentiment has taken a knock on Friday, with bitcoin (BTC) last down around 1.5% and back in the low $30,000s following reports the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has informed applicants like BlackRock that recent spot bitcoin ETF filings are “inadequate”.

The market’s downside may be an overreaction, as a simple refiling process could address the SEC concerns.

Either way, the news is weighing on blue-chip cryptocurrency, though it hasn’t been enough to take the wind of the rally certain major altcoins and meme coins have been enjoying.

Bitcoin alternatives continue to pump, with eCash (XEC) up over 55% in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) up over 21%, Litecoin (LTC) up over 13%, Bitcoin SV (BSV) up nearly 10% and Zcash (ZEC) up close to 9%.

Meanwhile, 2.0 versions of popular meme coins are also in fashion on Friday.

Here are the hottest pairs according to Decentralized Exchange (DEX) analytics website DEX Tools.
